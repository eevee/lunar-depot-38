# Lunar Depot 38

This is a little shooty platformer made for [Ludum Dare 38](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/lunar-depot-38).

It requires [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) 0.10.2 and nothing else.

Made with [glip](http://glitchedpuppet.com/), who made the music, sounds, art, story, setting, and [universe](http://floraverse.com/).  Really, all I did was make it go.


## Running

Just install LÖVE and run this repository with it.

Or see the [itch.io page](https://eevee.itch.io/lunar-depot-38) for downloads and a friendlier description.


## Built with

- [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/), a Lua game engine

- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), a text editor for nerds

- [Aseprite](http://www.aseprite.org/), a pixel art editor

- [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/), a map editor
